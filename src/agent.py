class Agent:
    """"Virtual mobile robot as agent

        The agent holds its state of position and orientation.

        An additional set of observations can be used in more advanced setups.

        The position is used in the same coordinate system as the
        maze.  The orientation is used in mathematical angle
        conventions, i.e. a horizontal direction to the right means
        0Â°, and positive angles are given in degrees,
        counter-clockwise.

        It has also some properties such as radius, which is used to
        compute collisions with the walls or other agents.

        It can execute some actions.

        At a simple level it rotates fixed but noisy angles, and make
        steps towards that direction (also noisy).

        At a complex more complex level it can rotate arbitrary angles
        and advance larger distances.

        The action methods (left, right, advance) do not perform anything.
        They simply provide the desired new state and the environment will
        use the information to compute a new state compatible with the
        information it holds.  Therefore, particularly advancing will
        change depending if a wall or similar is met
